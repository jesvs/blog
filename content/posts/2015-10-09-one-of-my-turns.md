## &#8220;One Of My Turns&#8221;

Day after day, love turns grey  
Like the skin of a dying man  
Night after night, we pretend it&#8217;s all right  
But I have grown older and  
You have grown colder and  
Nothing is very much fun any more.

And I can feel one of my turns coming on.  
I feel cold as razor blade  
Tight as a tourniquet  
Dry as a funeral drum. 

Run to the bedroom, in the suitcase on the left  
You&#8217;ll find my favourite axe  
Don&#8217;t look so frightened  
This is just a passing phase  
Just one of my bad days  
Would you like to watch TV?  
Or get between the sheets?  
Or contemplate the silent freeway?

Would you like something to eat?  
Would you like to learn to fly?  
Would you like to see me try?  
Would you like to call the cops?  
Do you think it&#8217;s time I stopped?  
Why are you running away?
