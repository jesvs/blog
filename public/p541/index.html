<li>Drama is never worth putting up with. If someone over age 18 can’t be a</li>
</ol>
<p>reasonable adult on a consistent basis, avoid that person.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>If you can make a reasonable living doing what you love, DO WHAT YOU</li>
</ol>
<p>LOVE.. You may not get rich, but you’ll get to do what you love. Don’t</p>
<p>quit your day job until doing what you love pays the bills, but don’t incur</p>
<p>big debt getting a law degree or an MBA if you really want to be an artist.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>It’s amazing how easy life is when you’re honest with yourself and others.</li>
</ol>
<p>This doesn’t mean you should be rude and inconsiderate, but it’s better to</p>
<p>be upfront when you have to rather than concealing things and letting</p>
<p>them grow.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Set up a safety fund. Yes, I know the savings account interest rates</li>
</ol>
<p>suck right now, but having 3-6 months of expenses in readily accessible</p>
<p>cash can save you a lot of hassle. It also allows you to loan money to</p>
<p>friends when needed (do this judiciously).</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>Start lifting weights yesterday.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t get fat.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Stand up for yourself. People will do anything for their own personal gain</li>
</ul>
<p>at others‘ expense: Cut in line, take money/property, bully/belittle, guilt-</p>
<p>trip… Do not accept this. These people know they’re doing the wrong</p>
<p>thing and back down surprisingly quickly when confronted. In a public</p>
<p>setting people tend to keep quiet until one person speaks up.</p>
<ul>
<li>Staying in shape is dirt simple. Body fat is dictated by what you eat and</li>
</ul>
<p>your activity. Working out affects 2 things mainly: fat and muscle.</p>
<p>Aerobic exercise burns fat and builds a little muscle. Resistance training</p>
<p>builds muscle and burns a little fat. If you’re fat you’re eating too much</p>
<p>and/or not doing aerobic exercise. Period.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no greater difference-maker in income than a college degree. I</li>
</ul>
<p>agree that it’s BS, but it’s true. It’s never too late to start. Just</p>
<p>attending school looks good on interviews. And many companies offer</p>
<p>tuition assistance so it doesn’t have to be that expensive.</p>
<ul>
<li>The biggest disappointments in life are the result of misplaced</li>
</ul>
<p>expectation. Tempering unrealistic expectations of how great something</p>
<p>will be can greatly reduce frustration.</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand that at 22 you are at your most energetic and most creative,</li>
</ul>
<p>but your labor is valued very little. All the more reason to 1) stand up for</p>
<p>yourself and look for the highest bidder and 2) get that degree.</p>
<ul>
<li>Try to picture us old fucks as the teenagers we used to be. Talk to that</li>
</ul>
<p>person.</p>
<p>stay limber. do lots of stretching every day. eat more vegetables. stay away</p>
<p>from meth.</p>
<p>LIVE. Experience as many things as you can. Go places. Do things. Do not fall</p>
<p>into routine. Do not become comfortable with TV and gadgets. Follow your</p>
<p>dreams, and be smart to ensure your success. Take chances. Carpe diem. No one</p>
<p>ever achieved anything great through laziness. Don’t let fear stop you from</p>
<p>enjoying life.</p>
<p>Love is a choice… it’s not magical. You are not destined. There is no such thing</p>
<p>as “the one.” Spend enough time with an attractive person, and biology kicks in.</p>
<p>So use your head, and ﬁnd someone you really enjoy spending time with. Cause</p>
<p>you’re going to have to do almost everything with this person. The person who</p>
<p>makes you feel most relaxed, most like youself, and accepts you as you are. The</p>
<p>person you don’t have to impress. This is your best chance for happiness.</p>
<p>If she’s got sexual hangups, and you like sex, ﬁnd someone else immediately. Only</p>
<p>a therapist can cure her.</p>
<p>Your credit score is really important. Don’t screw it up.</p>
<p>Everything in moderation. Don’t be a slave to any substance, especially food.</p>
<p>Don’t smoke cigarettes. If you do, join a program and quit immediately. It’s a</p>
<p>total waste. If you want to smoke pot, don’t do it every day. (Harder than you</p>
<p>might think.)</p>
<p>Don’t get fat.</p>
<p>Don’t ignore the obvious. Think with you head, not your heart. Take</p>
<p>responsibility. The future is coming, whether you want it to or not.</p>
<p>The world is full of bad people who will hurt and control you. Stand up for</p>
<p>youself. Do not pity them. Beware charity cases.</p>
<p>Avoid negativity and negative people.</p>
<p>Always do what’s right.</p>
<p>Don’t buy things.. buy EXPERIENCES.</p>
<p>That.. is a profound statement. I lived the experience thing at 40 I am doing</p>
<p>pretty good for myself. I am uber happy as well incidentally.</p>
<ol>
<li>The girl you love in your twenties (early twenties, at least) probably won’t be</li>
</ol>
<p>the girl you love in your thirties. Much in the same way that women undergo</p>
<p>some sort of change between the ages of 18 and 22, guys will change- probably</p>
<p>a little later than girls. Out of all my friends, I think they’re all divorced at least</p>
<p>once by now.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>If I could go back, I’d say that pretty much every white-collar job that paid</li>
</ol>
<p>well in 1990 won’t be a good job prospect in 2010. The US is drifting towards a</p>
<p>service-based economy, and that’s that.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Save money, and start saving early. Not that it’ll help any, of course; the</li>
</ol>
<p>stock market is rigged against the individual investor; saving money with a bank</p>
<p>will ensure you’ll get sharped there, too. In fact, you’ll get ripped off no matter</p>
<p>what you try to do, and the dollar is probably going to crash long before you’re</p>
<p>ready to retire anyway, so either make some highly educated investments in</p>
<p>collectibles, or just try to limp by, staying out of debt and packing away what</p>
<p>you can in your 401(k) and in the stock market. Not that either will be worth</p>
<p>anything in 20-40 years, but who knows.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>Read more. And not just blogs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Little things that you want but don’t necessarily need cost money, and they</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>add up. This is why nobody in my age bracket seems to have money anymore:</p>
<p>that $30/month cell phone (or whatever it costs- I don’t own one), that cable</p>
<p>TV, that 42″ plasma TV, a new car every few years, etc. But, hell. See rule #3:</p>
<p>that money you save this way may not be worth anything by the time the dollar</p>
<p>crashes anyway.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Don’t stick your dick in crazy. Unless you want to. Might be fun for a while,</li>
</ol>
<p>but- shit, man. It’s crazy.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Help your fellow man- the whole “Today you, tomorrow me” thing. Know how</li>
</ol>
<p>to change a tire, jump a car, safely bust a car window when a kid is stuck inside,</p>
<p>render ﬁrst aid, etc. I spent several years as a volunteer ﬁreﬁghter/EMT, and</p>
<p>when I started, I didn’t know shit about what to do in an emergency. I even have</p>
<p>my extra class ham radio license, if communications go to complete and total</p>
<p>shit. That way, I can ask what the weather is like in Santa Monica when Phoenix</p>
<p>has been wiped off the map by the world’s ﬁrst inland tsunami. Not sure how ham</p>
<p>radio will help, but all my neighbors will think it’s cool- the ones not dead and</p>
<p>stuff, anyway.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Those guys you went to high school with? They’ll all be fat and balding. Little</li>
</ol>
<p>tip: it’s the sugar and carbohydrates that make you fat, the soda, the pizza</p>
<p>crust, the cake and cookies and candy that everyone else at the ofﬁce brings in</p>
<p>as treats. If you skip those, you might dodge a bullet- and an expanding</p>
<p>waistline. Drink ice water.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>
<p>Dream.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn to ignore some people. Arguments on the Internet are like the</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>proverbial winning at the Special Olympics.</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>Put things in context. 65 million years ago, the dinosaurs died out. We’re still</li>
</ol>
<p>arguing over how T. rex walked (or ran), much less whether they had a blog. Do</p>
<p>things that matter, because time runs out.</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>Be polite, be courteous, and at least dream that civilization can be civil’. A</li>
</ol>
<p>society is the sum of its parts.</p>
