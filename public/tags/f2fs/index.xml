      <description>I run Kodi on my Raspberry Pi 3 mainly to watch live streams and the occasional YouTube video. Along with the media player I also run a pair of Go programs to scrape, store and analyze web data. On New Year’s Eve the root partition on a 32GB SD card got full, this rendered the whole system unresponsive. No big deal, I said. Without ssh access nor physical console, I pulled the power plug from the Pi, took the card out and mounted it on my workstation.</description>
